# TweetMyRiver

This plugin was generated with Plugin Builder and enables users to extract, translate, and filter tweets from a river layer, allowing for their classification into different Cultural Ecosystem Services categories. For detailed instructions on how to use the plugin and understand its structure, you can follow this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF1VT5qy0NI&t=2s 

To ensure the plugin's functionality, it requires certain external Python libraries that need to be installed within your python environment. To intsall them on the QGIS Windows environment you have to use the "OSGeo4wShell" which is installed by default when you install QGIS (https://landscapearchaeology.org/2018/installing-python-packages-in-qgis-3-for-windows/). To do so, you open the OSGeo4wShell and type the following commands to install the required packages and their recommended versions for this plugin: 
- "python -m pip install Tweepy==4.12.1"
- "python -m pip install openpyxl==3.0.10"
- "python -m pip install deep_translator==1.11.0"
- "python -m pip install nltk==3.8.1"
- "python -m pip install scikit_learn==1.2.1"
- "python -m pip install xlsxwriter==3.0.8"
