# TweetMyRiver

This repository contains three Python files corresponding to the executable processes in the plugin: data extraction, data translation and filtering, and final predictions.

We have used the "pyinstaller" library to generate the ".exe" files used in the plugin.

You can find the ".exe" files inside the plugin folder. To locate this folder, first access the QGIS folder (usually located in the "roaming" folder). Then navigate to the "QGIS3" folder, followed by "profiles", "default" (or the profile you are using in QGIS), "python", "plugins", and then enter the "Tweet my river" plugin folder (make sure you have downloaded it first). Inside the "allProcesses" folder, you will find the "EXECUTABLES" folder where you can replace the existing ".exe" files. Note that if you replace the files with your own code, they must have the same names as the original files; otherwise, the plugin may not work as expected.

For any changes and suggestions regarding the plugin code, please contact us at ollorente@icra.cat.
